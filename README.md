Introduction
SPILADY (pronounced as [spileidi]) is a computer program written at Culham Centre for Fusion Energy, Oxfordshire OX14 3DB, United Kingdom, from March 2014 to July 2015. It is a spin-lattice dynamics code intended to serve as an introductory computer simulation tool for undergraduate students, scientists, researchers, and interested members of the public familiar with molecular dynamics.

Reference material
Papers, giving a fairly detailed description of the spin-lattice dynamics simulation methodology and explaining the fundamentals of the method, are listed below. A SPILADY user is advised to refer to the material given in the papers when performing simulations, as the papers contain answers to questions that we are not able to cover in detail in this manual.
